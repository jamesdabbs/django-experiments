Experiments in Django
=====================

This repository documents (the first of what I hope will be) several experiments
testing, profiling and comparing new techniques in Django. It includes:

wide_tables
    An exploration of optimizations which may be useful when dealing with models
    with a large number of fields.

The source code should be documented, but it may be more instructive to explore
accompanying write-ups on `my blog <http://blog.jdabbs.com/>`_. Comments always
welcome.
